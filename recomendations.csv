Director, and screenplay writer, Kleber Mendonca Filho puts in too many unnecessary scenes that add nothing to the film or plot except to tell us more than we need to know about Clara, who is at the center of the film. There is a scene at a cemetery, another of Clara's grandbaby running around nude and still another of a couple having sex on a beach not to forget an explicit orgy scene."", """", ""The story is basically of Clara who is the last tenet who owns an apartment in a building that a developer wants to tear down and make a tower of condos. She is comfortable with her life and has no desire to sell, move, uproot the life she has. We learn about Clara's daily life whether going for a swim every morning at the beach across the street, her battle with cancer that has left her scarred, he daughter recently divorced, one son who is gay and another son who is the father of her favorite grandson, having a night out with girlfriends, a possible romantic encounter that doesn't work out, a 'escort' that does plus her work as a music journalist writing books along with relatives and friends from the past and present. At the same time there is the story of the developer and his grandson trying at first to buy her out and then taking other methods."", """", ""Along the way there are discussions about how skin color affects lives in Brazil, where the picture takes place, as society gets into business and education can make a man's grandson think he the smartest one of making decisions to move things along. There are the children who who think the mother is making a selfish decision in not selling the house and her housekeeper/friend who lost her son a year before. And folks we haven't even touched upon the lifeguard, the church group and things going on inside and out side the building and Clara's apartment."", """", ""What makes \""Aquaruis\"" special, a film to watch, is the performance by Sonia Braga who lets you know everything about the woman by the way she walks, talks, treats others, dresses, laughs, deals with problems, listens to music and shows love to family, friends and life. Braga defines the camera falling in love with a face."", """", ""Watching \""Aquarius\"" I wished there was a fast forward button if for no other reason than to get past the cemetery scene and the three others mentioned in the first paragraph."" ]";2

Whew! She did. I am saying almost the same thing about Sally Hawkins playing the title role in this film. Her transformation into Maud, and her acting, draws you into the film to such a point that you forget she is Sally Hawkins, the actress."", ""“Maudie” is a love story between two people who not only are different from everyone else but completely different from each other. I wasn’t aware the screenplay, by Sherry White, was based on a true story until the end and it made me wonder how true it really is. About 30-35 minutes into the film I gasped and really didn’t believe what I had just seen but that was only part of the story. There are sweet, funny, sad and cruel moments along the way. Neither Maud nor Everett, played by Ethan Hawke, had an early easy life and when we meet them they are still struggling in the world they inhabit."", ""The film is 1 hour and 55 minutes, with Newfoundland and Labrador filling in for Nova Scotia, is, necessarily, slow moving but still could have been cut by about 10 minutes."", ""The film basically concentrates of the story of Maud and Everett with minor characters such as Gabrielle Rose as Maud’s aunt and Zachery Bennett as her brother along with Kari Matchett as a vacationing New Yorker and Billy MacLellan as possibly the only friend Everett might have. Though Hawke does a fairly good job he does not quite reach Hawkins’ level."", ""“Maudie” in many ways is not an easy film to sit through but should be seen for Hawkins performance, and possibly, learn about an artist you didn’t know about. I hope I am wrong but I don’t think this movie will ‘sell’ to the public."" ]";2

They interact, sharing companionship and when Paul (Olivier Gourmet) enters the film as a potential romantic interest for Claire you can’t wait to see when, if, Beatrice ruins it."", ""With the cancer angle, this could have turned into a soap opera but watching Beatrice ordering wine, eating fatty meat, having dessert and smoking knowing that none are positive in her coming fight with cancer she is so exasperating yet endearing that Clair can’t turn away from her."", ""There is an interesting subplot dealing with Clair’s job and the clinic she works in has to close because the job of a midwife is fading in place of what is called ‘baby technicians’ plus her son is not only thinking of quitting medical school but his girlfriend is pregnant. No, not a soap opera, but things that can happen in life to make/help people change."", ""In regards to this, it is great seeing a film—usually French—is not shy about showing a baby actually being born or a mother openly nursing her baby without hiding her breast."", ""“The Midwife” is the wonder of watching two women bring magic to the screen in a delightful, warm, absorbing and winning story about relationships and how opposites can help each other."" ]";2

Florence Pugh goes from a naïve, shy young girl to a woman who takes control of her life and in many cases those around her and how it changes her."", ""“Lady Macbeth” is a fairly short movie in these days with 2+ hour films in that it only runs 89 minutes, though it does seem longer at times."" ]";2

Maureen believes she has paranormal powers as a medium as did her twin brother Lewis who died from a condition that could also affect her eventually. The twins made a deal that whoever died first would send a ‘sign’ from ‘the otherside’."", ""We meet others along the way from Kyra’s lover of 2 years, Lewis’s widow, Maureen’s boyfriend and others but none have almost as much screen time as her iPhone except, possibly, the various laptop computers which are all around."", ""Kristen Stewart dominates the movie whether texting, traveling on trains between Paris and London or motoring around Paris on her Peugeot scooter, being topless for one reason or another and trying to communicate with her brother or being pursued by a mysterious stranger, possibly from ‘beyond’ in that iPhone."", ""Stewart’s face implies more than her words and she easily makes her character believable but I am on the fence regarding her appeal as an actress which in this case may be due, partially, to her director Olivier Assayas. In their first picture together, “Clouds of Sils Maria”, he and the cast received rave reviews and Stewart was the first American to win the French’s Cesar Award for Best Supporting Actress but I don’t see his touch here. In fact, a few scenes that should have had the audience jumping out of their seats, gets very little reaction. Neither does he, or the sound editor, do their job when it comes to the French subtitles or level of some English lines important to the film."", ""“Personal Shopper” did get me interested in Kristen Stewart but at this point not enough to make me go see her future films if there are other films in theatres at the same time that I would like to see for one reason or another."" ]";2

Yes it is crude, sort of adds to a stereotype about Black men but Haddish will be remembered for years just as the scene in “There’s Something About Mary” with Cameron Diaz and ‘hair gel’."", ""On the other hand there is a urination scene that puts any men have done on film to shame and debases the women and then repeat it even though it is so fake."", ""The main thing going for “Girls Trip” is the feeling you get that the 4 leads; Haddish, Regina Hall (Ryan), Queen Latifah (Sasha) and Jada Pinkett Smith (Lisa) have truly been friends since high school and all have problems to be dealt with which they eventually do. Regarding the latter there is a touching scene that eventually got the Black women in the audience to cheer, shout at the screen and laugh."", ""For each woman there is a man with the pairing of Lisa and Malik (Kofi Siriboe) with the latter, unknowingly, responsible for the grapefruit scene and demonstrating it, against his will, in a later scene while very successful Ryan is married to very successful hunky looking guy, Stewart, (Mike Colter) though Sasha’s ‘man’ happens to be a lamp---sorry, you will have to see it—while Dina will go after any male who is breathing!

And just as she had that great waitress to a customer line near the beginning at the end she has a better line about not fooling around with mothers."", ""“Kidnap” is a short, 81-83 minute action film, with plenty of action with Halle Berry doing a good job along with Sage Correa as her son, Chris McGinn and Lew Temple as the kidnappers, a few minor characters but let’s not forget the crook’s green 1980 Ford Mustang and Berry’s red Chrysler minivan as they are stars along with Berry."", ""Along with director Luis Prieto, screenwriter, director of photography Flavio Labiano and a good score by Federico Jusid, Hally Berry stars in a fast paced, filled with tension popcorn summer movie aptly titled “Kidnap”."" ]";2
7;the-hero;7;GreatMartin;/user/GreatMartin;"[ ""Sam Elliot is one of those very rare actors who can make a bad role and/or movie better just because he is doing a role and he does it effortlessly! He is very seldom the star of a movie but whatever star is playing opposite in a scene is forgotten as your eyes will go to him. Tall, lean, with a silver mane any old man would envy plus a mustache that falls in love with women (see the movie!) and a voice that can melt any female, plus quite a few males, that even with 50 movies plus 137 episodes and television movies he has never reached that upper tier of actors and has very seldom been listed above the title."", ""In \""the Hero\"" Sam Elliot, and that mustache, star in the film experiencing every emotion a man can have including all the extremes and takes the audience along with him. We see, and believe, a woman, Charlotte (Laura Prepon), 35 years younger than him, falling in love and pursuing him. We feel bad for him when he messes up an audition and we cheer when accepting an award his speech goes viral to over 2 million people. His disconnect with his daughter Lucy (Krysten Ritter) is heartbreaking and his reaching out to the wife he is divorced from, Kathryn Ross (his real life wife), is touching as you understand why they divorced."", ""The story revolves around Lee Hayden, who made a western movie four decades ago that was a big hit but he is now making a living doing voice over commercials. His best, and seemingly only, friend is a fellow actor Jeremy (Nick Offerman) who had appeared in a TV series with him and now makes a living selling drugs, including to Lee and Charlotte which is how they meet. On the same day that he is asked to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Western Appreciation and Preservation Guild he receives the news from his doctor that the tumors he has found on Lee's pancreas is malignant."", ""Though we wish \""The Hero\"" had followed, and gotten more into, the relationship between Charlotte and Lee just watching Sam Elliot makes sitting through this 93 minute movie a treat. Stretching it with too many waves landing on the beach, it takes place in Los Angeles, Director Brett Haley, who also wrote the screenplay with Marc Basch, throws in some not meant to be but are laughable scenes involving the poetry of Edna St. Millay and Lee, Charlotte and Jeremy smoking weed in scenes that add nothing to the movie except time. The soundtrack offers many songs adding to the many different moods in the film."", ""For fans of Sam Elliot this is a must see fan while those who may be familiar with his face should come to see it for the actor.

With Kumail Nanjiani, who I am familiar with from the HBO show “Silicon Valley”, starring and Judd Apatow producing I expected a lot of laughs and they are delivered in grins, smiles, laughs, out loud guffaws along with nods of the head that derive from real moments in life that all can identify. The drama also gets the spotlight and in some scenes you will be crying and laughing at the same time while in others the tears will flow. Yes the romance is there and it is as romantic as in any film you have seen."", ""The two really minor negatives, surprisingly, are the stand up routines by the real in life stand up comics Aidy Bryant, Kurt Braunohler and Bo Burnham and the interactions between them and Kumail but none really take up that much time."", ""Not getting into the screenplay itself, written by Nanjiani and his real wife Emily V.

Anupan Kher and Zenobia as his parents could teach today’s parents in how to make your child feel guilty, especially the mother."", ""A big discovery for me was Zoe Kazan who I don’t recall seeing before. She makes Emily a real person whether it be in her kookiness, ‘only having sex once the first time with somebody’, who is going to be a therapist and in some scenes could really use therapy. She makes a lasting impression any time she is on screen but also has you thinking of her when she is not in a scene."", ""Ray Romano has never caught my attention as I was usually more interested in his co-stars, whether on television or movies, but here as a father, referring to his daughter, says “Being a parent is a nightmare. Loving somebody this much sucks” he is funny and heartbreaking sometimes in the same sentence."", ""I could talk for days about Holly Hunter’s performance in “Big Sick”. She appears on screen about 30-40 minutes into the film and steals every scene from everyone in the film for the rest of the film. No way do you want to get her teed off in a comic club because no matter how tall or big you are you aren’t going to win! Don’t you dare hurt her daughter because you will get her wrath, sneers and coldness but show her daughter love and with one gesture you know you will never be able to do anything wrong again. I certainly hope she is remembered at award time."", ""Yes Kumail Nanjiani is playing himself, even being called Kumail, but you get to know more than the comedian. You get to know the man, the actor, the writer, the comedian, the man who can woo women with doe eyes, a smile and caring.

In the first movie “Norman” (see my review Wednesday, May 3) he plays a New York City ‘fixer’, schemer while in today’s film, “The Dinner” he is a Congressman running for Governor and he is completely two different men in appearance, acting and persona."", ""I really never know what to expect from a movie as I very seldom read reviews before I go see one and generally will pick a movie based on the cast and/or any vibes I picked up about it regarding genre and story. “The Dinner” has a major cast of Gere, Laura Linney, who I have never seen give a bad performance and, mostly, as she does in this film, gives an outstanding performance, Steve Coogan, a strong actor and Rebecca Hall who I had seen in a few movies and seemed to be waiting for that breakout role."", ""Gere, married to his second wife Hall, and Coogan, married to Linney, are brothers whose mother favored the former while the latter seems to have inherited the mental illness he has from her.

At the very beginning Coogan remarks about the cost of a bottle of wine being sinful. The purpose of the meeting finally comes to light and the questions the film wants to ask are that of how much will/would a parent do to protect their child, how much of an obligation do they have to their families and what should they do or not do."", ""Though “The Dinner” is based on a novel by Herman Koch it is almost as if the director/screenwriter Oren Moverman had taken a play and wanted to ‘open’ it up. Flashbacks to earlier years, to events that happened earlier in the evening, a trip to the Gettysburg battlefields, many voiceovers, to classroom scenes of Coogan, who was a teacher of history, plus the dinner itself blurs what should have been a linear telling instead of losing its focus."", ""Now as a man who loves food even the restaurant scenes become dull as they are all over the place as for different reasons the party of 4 is moved from room to room and the descriptions of the plates soon blend into each other."", ""Many times the direction by Moverman, the cinematography by Bobby Bukowski and the music by Elijah Brueggemann are disconcerting to what is taking place on the screen."", ""The acting of the cast in “The Dinner” is certainly consistently top rate and reasons enough to see the film plus I need someone to explain the ending to me!"" ]";2

Huppert is always fascinating to watch, even as the character seems to spiral in unexpected directions. It's not exemplary, but it is an unusual, complex and interesting experience."" ]";6

He verbally bullies his wife (Viola Davis) and son (Jovan Adepo), while ranting about his authority and significance. While Wilson's language borders on poetic, the father's unsympathetic character makes the situations hard to handle. Of course, the performances are superb with Davis' sensitive portray illuminating the screen. Director Washington has kept every moment of this long encounter compelling (it runs 2:19) with crackling energy and dynamic force.

Writer/director Jordan Peele has created a slowly mounting sense of fear that's more about racial tension than cinematic scares. Still, the sinister portent builds with steady apprehension that leads to a brutal outcome. While satirical observations on prejudice add humor (and some plot points strain logic), the overall effect is suitably chilling and completely entertaining."" ]";6

Before hitting the battlefield, the narrative sets up the events that formed his beliefs, the woman back home who supported him and the intense antagonism he faced from the Army. His rich, yet subtle performance once again proves that Garfield is one of the finest actors of his generation. As for director Mel Gibson, the romantic and emotional elements are richly told (albeit in a traditional structure and style), but it's the staging of the battle that makes the strongest impression: The most gruesome and violently brutal depiction of the horrors of battle since \""Private Ryan.\"" Even though it could easily lose 30 of its 131-minutes, this remains a potent drama and an affecting portrait of a brave and principled man."" ]";6

It's also a somewhat gripping suspense drama. Amy Adams plays a fancy LA gallery owner who gets a copy of her ex-husband's (Jake Gyllenhaal) novel, which is a thinly disguised revenge narrative. The film alternates between her reading it, the story being reenacted and flashbacks to their past relationship. The concept is sometimes clever as it pieces the parts together, but sometimes it's merely dominated by the beauty of the design. Adams and Gyllenhaal are both fine, but the standout performance comes from Michael Shannon as the sheriff.  Even though the movie is compelling and sensual, the drama doesn't always live up to the aesthetics."" ]";6

Even though their chemistry is fine, this is really Pratt's movie: he beautifully manages to capture the confusion, longing, desperation and other emotions that plague his plight.

Unlike many of these flicks, this one doesn't rely on typically destructive physical encounters. Instead there are trippy visual effects and cool superpowers. There are also several tedious scenes of metaphysical mumbo jumbo that stop the pace and a sometimes confusing sense of what's actually happening. Cumberbatch ably handles his character's haughtiness with depth. There's also a touch of humor to keep things from getting too self-important. Overall, it's more original and better than many in the franchise, but it's still somewhat mystifying and overly talky. NOTE: As usual, stay thru the credits for a somewhat puzzling teaser."" ]";6

With the sweetly touching, skillfully underplayed performances by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga (both of whom will surely see Oscar noms) their situation is rendered even more poignant. Some may find the pace slow, but I found it quietly compelling. In addition to the historical significance of the case, this film beautifully portrays the enduring love that made their relationship transcend racial boundaries."" ]";6

The premise seems a bit preposterous and it's not really clear how the plot's complex machinations happen. Affleck stays pretty stone faced thru it all, registering as a mysteriously-connected mastermind and a sure-shot action hero.

First time writer/director Barry Jenkins let's every scene play out with compelling quiet: Simple and underplayed, but with an underlying intensity that's achingly bittersweet.

He sets up the culture with quick-cut macho exchanges, but his magnificent recreation of the chaos and calamity makes the experience exceptionally gripping. It's a dizzying outburst of devastation.

This film, which is a masterful first effort by writer/director Nate Parker, doesn't revel in the violence or extreme cruelty. Even though there are appropriately brutal moments, he's chosen to focus on the emotional experiences that led to Turner's transformation. The cinematography is beautiful and the performances are forceful. It takes a bit too long to build momentum, but once it does, the film builds to moving and powerful final image."" ]";6

Like the predecessors, this film is breezy and fun. The women in the audience were laughing a lot more than I did, but I was still entertained. The pace is spritely and the situations amusing.

As her devotedly protective husband, Hugh Grant is solid and charming, but it's Simon Helberg, as her pianist, who steals the movie with his hysterical physical comedy. The scene where we hear her sing for the first time is a comic highlight of the year. She's blissfully oblivious to her lack of talent and decides to play Carnegie Hall. Thus spins the conflict that anchors the plot. Yes, her singing is astonishingly bad, but director Stephen Freer's loving approach elevates the film above a one-joke song."" ]";6

This film is more about the investigation into Captain “Sully” Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) after he saved 155 people by landing his plane on the river. The structure alternates between his struggles with the sudden attention, the inquiry itself and the fateful flight. The flight is staged several times in a very rational manner, never wildly tense but more procedural (not surprising considering director straightforward Clint Eastwood's style). However, the visual effects are stunningly real. While the behind-the-scenes story is fascinating and Hanks maintains his steely resolve, this is more an examination than an experience.

This is NOT a wildly-violent crime caper or a Tarantinoesque script with snappy repartee.

The audience was almost exclusively women and they were loving it. The script crammed full of F-bombs and wacky acts, much of them funny. As is the fate of many modern movies, it sometimes tries too hard to be outrageous. The mom message gets a bit heavy-handed, but there are moments of genuine sweetness that adds to the appeal.

A lot's going on and even with the deliberate pace, it manages to maintain interest. Writer/director Gary Ross has purposely let this sprawling story take place slowly and took advantage of McConaughey's star power with lots of lingering close-ups.

When she decides to go public, a number of sycophants rally around her, while her husband tries desperately to shield her from reality. Although this is billed as a comedy (and it does have humorous elements, esp. when she sings), it's really a gentle drama about a disillusioned woman, played with touching grace by Catherine Frot.

He and Crowe have decent chemistry, but it's young Angourie Rice (as the adept daughter) who adds character appeal.

He ends up witnessing something bad backstage after a gig at a gathering place for neo-Nazis. The group is first confused, then terrorized as the club's owner (Patrick Stewart) tries to deal with their inconvenient presence. Even before things go horribly wrong, the characters are compelling and the sense of dread starts to creeps in.

The run-up to the encounter unfolds effectively, but isn't especially funny. Actually, other than Spacey, there aren't a lot of laffs. It's more about quiet humor than big comedy.

The action alternates between the harrowing ride to the rescue (helmed by Chris Pine, playing a determined introvert) and the attempts to stay afloat by the tanker’s crew (led by an equally underplayed Casey Affleck). Toss in a heartfelt romance and you have all the ingredients of a classic adventure. The perilous challenge of the pummeling waves makes for formidable visuals, even though the obviously CGI source lacks a realistic edge.

First-time director Dan Trachtenberg knows how to manipulate the action with dynamic images (and snappy editing by Stefan Grube).

Ultimately, a dozen Marvel universe superheroes duke it out, using their assorted powers to keep it interesting. At 146 minutes, it's too long: the dialogue often drags and every action scene (although edited with dizzying velocity) runs longer than necessary. In its favor are some expectedly neat special effects and a likeable cast. Each member gets to create a few moments of character (esp. the new Spidey delightfully played by Tom Holland).

A return trip home complicates her life. It's a sentimental story with lots of tears and sweet moments. Some enjoyable supporting characters (esp. bossy landlady Julie Walters) add a lively touch.

Like most movies about social injustice, there's plenty of outrage at their plight (albeit mild in this case) and the inevitable brave stands required by others (again, lacking fervor). Moore keeps a lid on her portrayal, letting Page be the sweet center of this movie. Her performance is truly touching.

Just when this film's age premise starts to wear thin, the relationships develop deeper implications.

The performances are universally compelling and director Ava DuVernay has masterfully crafted an authoritative work of cinema.

Timothy Spall gives a bravura performance in the title role, gruffly grunting his way thru all of his encounters. It's a fascinating portrait with plenty of eccentric supporting characters (as is common with director Mike Leigh). Cinematographer Dick Pope has infused every shot, including the lovely landscapes, with a soft palette and lustrous glow.

Adams turns this halting, insecure character into a nuanced and compelling performance. Director Tim Burton minimized the bizarre flourishes expected from his work, to tell a straightforward narrative. While it's a fascinating story and Adams is worth the ticket, the film feels more like an informative historical replay, than a moving personal drama.

Most of the comedy comes from Rock's signature irreverent insights, even when they come out of the other actors' mouths. Much of it is amusing and sometimes funny.

Meryl Streep brings her authenticity to nuanced and touching brilliance as the Witch and Chris Pine's arrogant prince reveals his comic charms better than \""Horrible Bosses 2\"" does. Director Rob Marshall successfully shortened it. He keeps it grounded in the humor and humanity, without resorting to dazzling cinematic tricks.

Even with the no-holds-barred depiction of his flaws, all of his hits are performed (with the real Brown's vocals) to make the experience a super-funky groove.

The story begins with him as a young boy, whose lyrical dreams depict his obsession with flying. When it follows his plane designer career, the story is interesting. There is a tragic subplot about the love of his life, which slows down the pacing.

At times it seems like an action film, but the fight scenes are often full of splashed blood and blurred action. At other times, it's an apocalyptic drama with bold statements about class and society. If you're willing to overlook the giant lapses in logic, you may find this movie to be an absorbing and original experience.

Even though the plot has no surprises, director Kenneth Branagh (who also plays the bad guy) has crafted a taut little mission. Unfortunately, the blurry camerawork obscures much of the action.

Visually, this is a symmetrical delight: the locations are gorgeous and the detail is exquisite. The deadpan dialogue and comical staging keeps the pacing on its toes.

Although Idris Elba (Mandela) and Naomie Harris (his wife Winnie) both create rich characters and the narrative is compelling, the whole thing lacks emotional power.

The team's frustrating attempts at winning the writer's approval are classic Disney magic: cheerful, earnest and genuinely funny.

What stands out most is the animation: simply beautiful ice and snow design, lovely lighting and wonderful inventiveness.

The large cast is peppered with notable actors, including Paul Giamatti, Zac Efron, Billy Bob Thornton and Marcia Gay Harden, and they help focus the impact.

Even with all the pain and emotion, the frequently ominous direction and menacing music telegraphed the situations. Performances, including the 3 sons, are strong and special effects are convincing.

The actors run the gamut from revelatory (Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Amanda Seyfried, Lucy Hale) to solid (Hugh Jackman, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter) to vocally weak (Russell Crowe). All of the singing is done live, so there's an intimate, expressive power that's distinctive.

Their relationship forms the story's emotional center, but the fact that she's a vampire complicates matters. There are haunting images and moments of intense, bloody attack (and one amazing car wreck), but the tender core of the film elevates it to well-crafted cinema. Never really scary, but powerful just the same."" ]";6

The characters are interesting and the situations are inventive. Each one of them is creative enough to have been developed into a full-length movie, but the abbreviated length, robust pace and imaginative direction keep make one immensely entertaining. My favorite was the conflict between the Audi driver and the \""redneck\"" (wickedly dark with a delightful ending)."" ]";6

The majority of this film takes place during his enemy encounters in Iraq, all shot with controlled, precise skill by director Clint Eastwood. This alternates with his struggles to adapt to the civilian world of husband and father, presented by Eastwood with empathy but restrained emotion. Although some scenes go on too long, the film's quiet intensity, the character's determination and Cooper's performance make for a compelling experience."" ]";6

Kate Winslet plays an unconventional landscape architect, who is hired to design and complete an unusual outdoor ballroom. Under the guidance of an architect (Matthias Schoenaerts), she struggles with doubters, the politics of court and various rivals. Despite the lavish settings and costumes, the performances are subdued and Rickman has kept a restrained hand on the proceedings.

This is really just a cat-and-mouse romance with a BDSM twist. It's success depends on the performances of the 2 leads and the director's skill at maintaining tension in what's basically a dialogue. Surprisingly, Dornan is prettier than Johnson, but they both create characters that are complex and compelling. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson has filled the film with sexually-charged stress and attractively erotic sex scenes. It's every woman's dream of a dazzling, devoted lover (granted, with some emotional complications) and it's played out with alluring skill."" ]";6
523;love-mercy;9;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""This is not the standard musician biopic, but a fascinating and immensely absorbing examination of the artistic, emotional and mental struggles of Brian Wilson (the creative powerhouse behind the Beach Boys). The timeline alternates between his peak years, when he was starting to experiment with their sound (played by Paul Dano) and the period after his breakdown (played by John Cusak), when therapist Dr. Eugene Landy dominated his existence. Both actors are mesmerizing, brilliantly capturing Wilson's complexity and charisma. As the woman who saves him, the usually outsize Elizabeth Banks is a quiet revelation. Producer-turned-director Bill Pohlad has crafted a compellingly complex examination into the creative process and one of the most effective studies of mental illness ever on screen. Although the musician's oppressive struggles keep the film in a continual dark place (with a sometimes slow pace), the film's quiet power and artistic mastery create an enthralling cinematic exploration. NOTE: The real Wilson performs the title song on camera during the credits."" ]";6

The film starts as a low-key romance, but slowly turns darker, as the young man discovers Escobar's evil power. From there, it transforms into a somewhat suspenseful ride, as he struggles to escape the web of cruelty and murder. Hutcherson nicely captures the bewildered innocence of his plight, while del Toro creates a subdued villain with a human side. This film's quiet power evolves into a disturbing journey. Subtitles when Spanish is spoken."" ]";6

The duo stumbles across an abandoned cop car and go for a joyride. When the sheriff (Kevin Bacon) discovers his situation, he scrambles to cover his mistake. The innocent enthusiasm of the boys provides continual amusement, while provoking perilous caution from us grown-ups who better appreciate the dangers they face. The Coen Brothers' early films come to mind as the simple narrative develops into a compelling and quietly suspenseful ride."" ]";6

It's only the outward manifestation of his well-defined and richly riveting character. He plays a boxing champ who loses virtually everything and struggles to recover his life and, more importantly, the custody of his daughter (an equally impressive performance by young Oona Laurence). Director Antoine Fuqua uses his mastery of the form to create many compelling moments and outstanding images. Expectedly, there are several extended, but not especially original boxing scenes. This film might have more effective if there were moments of humor to lighten the load. As it stands, the potential for a truly powerful picture is weakened by its relentless seriousness. Gyllenhaal's performance is impressive, but the plot's predictability, the director's heavy handedness and the harsh dark drama impede its full potential."" ]";6

This promises some mind-stretching concepts, framed by confusing scientific discussions. You can also expect some cool visuals, although the camera often focuses more on faces than spectacular effects. As for the human aspect, it's all about his emotional connection with his daughter back on Earth. The power of love has its part to play and McConaughey cries a lot! Hans Zimmer's overpowering music sometimes gets in the way and some of the story clichés dilute the potential majesty of the voyage. Don't get me wrong, there's lots to recommend in Christopher Nolan's splendid film and the 169 minute length never bores, it was just less amazing than I expected."" ]";6

Judd Apatow adds his masterful comic direction to make every gag work even better.

It traces the incredible talent from her teenage years, featuring performance clips that reveal her unique and astounding ability. There's early insight into her personal demons and the pressures of fame that turned her story into a tragedy of press harassment, need for love and substance abuse (on-screen song lyrics reveal even more).

Although the original trio of stars has a few moments, this one sets up a compelling new group of players to continue the franchise. The storytelling is solid and the battles are OK, but there's nothing especially original or innovative about this new world (even the popular BB-8 is a re-imagining of R2D2).

Almost immediately, her granddaughter shows up needing $600 to pay for an abortion. They spend the rest of the time trying to raise the cash. Tomlin is enjoyably cantankerous and cruel-mouthed as she runs thru her repertoire of old friends and flames (including Sam Elliott in the most sensitive performance of his career). There are only a few outright laughs (and most of them are in the trailer), but the spunky energy of the relationships and Tomlin's undeniable force tint the film toward upbeat humor. An entertaining character study."" ]";6

Garfield and Shannon both create compelling characters and the scenes of families being evicted are heartbreaking. An absorbing drama."" ]";6

Although there are plenty of other interesting performances (Helen Mirren as Hedda Hopper is especially delicious), it's dominated by Cranston/Trumbo's wiseacre dialogue and outsize personality. The period recreations add visual appeal and the costumes are especially attractive (every tie is fantastic). The writing is snappy and involving, but the story sags in the middle when the drama drags it down. Still, a fascinating history lesson centered around Cranston's potent portrayal."" ]";6

The dialogue is dotted with amusing one-liners and every character gets a few personal moments. What’s missing: any shocks, tension or surprises (including nothing at the very end of the credits, although there is one quickie after the closing title sequence). Even at 2:20, it never lags, but there's nothing spectacular or innovative in this sequel. Still, writer/director Joss Whedon has jammed it full of entertaining, popcorn fun."" ]";6

The next 90 minutes (yes, it's 147 minutes long) watches as the 3 major members (Easy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube) go their separate ways and struggle with their own success. Director F Gary Gray has succeeded in crafting an environment that effectively reflects their aggressive, intense world, while managing to create sensitive portraits of the main characters. It's noisy, brutal and decadent, yet informative, empathetic and affecting."" ]";6

The first half is spent in their confined environment before expanding the drama to examine their crisis in facing the real world. Without ever resorting to easy or expected devices, this film is sweet, touching, suspenseful and moving. Director Lenny Abrahamson has brilliantly created an intimate story that's powerful, yet understated. The best film I've seen this year."" ]";6

This cinematic retelling effectively captures the details of this incredible situation, while attempting to establish emotional connections with a handful of the men. The depiction the dire challenges is presented with dramatic incredulity and the personal moments are mildly involving. It's more fascinating than gripping, but still a well-told story. One weird Hollywood tradition still holds: this takes place in Chile, but everyone speaks English with Spanish accents. To make things even more confusing, there's one Spanish-speaking reporter and all the writing is in Spanish."" ]";6

While the tech gets a nod, the focus is on the man and his relationships with 3 primary people (Steve Wozniak, John Sculley, his daughter Lisa). Sorkin has brilliantly combined a lot of information into a crowded, time-limited backdrop. Director Danny Boyle has added a frantic, intimate style to keep the focus on the people (all of whom are superb, esp. Michael Fassbender in the title role and Kate Winslet as his \""work wife\""). While demonstrating Jobs' genius, this film clearly shows his gruff professional style and challenges with relationships. A fascinating, informative and compelling glimpse into his life."" ]";6

This solemn film tells the story of his rise to power in Boston and the collaboration with the FBI that allowed him to become so ruthless. Depp's steely cold exterior results in a subdued portrayal that sometimes exposes the undercurrent of rage and violence. The entire cast inhabits their rough characters with unattractive authenticity. The continuous overtone of anger, mistrust and unhappiness pervades the film's every minute, but this is also its weakness. Some lighter moments would have added contrast and mounting tension would have made the experience more intense. As it stands, the performances are strong, but the constant low level of conflict never builds to any emotional or dramatic impact."" ]";6

He became known as Lily Elbe, one of the first known transgenders to also undergo sexual reassignment surgery. Redmayne is perfect for the role, not only because he makes such a beautiful woman (more so than the real thing: see below), but because he’s such a gifted and brilliantly expressive actor. His delicate nuanced portrayal is exceptionally touching. But this story is about both of them and Vikander also turns in a moving performance. The locations are lovely and the dresses gorgeous, but every plot development takes too long to unfold. Even with the languid pace, this film is a quietly sweet and beautifully tender examination of love and self expression."" ]";6

He determines to stay alive by using science, ingenuity and pluck, while NASA strategizes on rescue plans. Unlike \""Gravity\"" (which it will be inevitably compared to) this is more about science than suspense. Solutions are methodically discussed and tried with few setbacks. Despite this more intellectual approach, Damon's performance is spirited, amusing and occasionally touching. Director Ridley Scott manages to make the moving parts and technical explanations acceptable, while mining a bit of emotion and even humor in the interactions. Overall, it's a well-crafted and captivating tale of human survival."" ]";6
542;in-the-heart-of-the-sea;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""Since this is the truth-based story that inspired 'Moby-Dick,\"" you'd expect it to be all about the crew vs. the whale. While that's a big part, this narrative expands to become a story of survival at sea. The encounters with the CGI creatures, as well as a harrowing storm, are amazingly rendered. On top of that, the grand style of the cinematography and rich look of the art direction add a layer of visual majesty. Then there's the actual drama: It unfolds with encounters and relationships that are too trite, flashes back to the storyteller (which halts the pace) and never really creates characters that are compelling (even Chris Hemworth seems like yet another superhero). The film attempts to be grand storytelling in a classic vein (albeit with lots of quick cuts), but lacks the spirit to capture the heart."" ]";6
543;macbeth-2015;8;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""You probably know the story, but it's never been told like this. First, it's been re-imagined with a more rustic, less grand style...often raw and dirty. Second, almost all of the dialogue is intensely introspective, no booming soliloquies here. Despite that, the performances are raw and passionate. The Scottish brogue sometimes makes the dialogue difficult to follow and the concentrated, deliberate pacing becomes a bit monotonous. Finally, the liberties with style are striking! In addition to the staggering Scottish landscapes, DP Adam Arkapaw has shot every scene with visual power that gives \""art film\"" a whole new meaning. The dialogue has been trimmed to make room for some beautifully shot (often in slo-mo) battles, quiet moments of ceremony and other evocative stylings. This is brilliant realization and masterful revelation of cinematic imagination."" ]";6

She’s not doing anything new here, just her usually spunky, prickly style, but she also manages a few moments of sweet vulnerability. There’s not really much plot, but depth is added thru flashbacks to events that formed her present state. Smith fans will not be disappointed, even though she’s much more crusty than stately in this role."" ]";6

When he decides to follow in his famous father's footsteps, he travels to Philadelphia to enlist the champ as his trainer. The plot follows a familiar structure: intimate personal moment, dramatic encounter, training montage, big fight…repeat. Fortunately, a massively muscled-up Michael B. Jordan brings a fierce energy and determination to his role. Surprisingly, the film's most compelling performance (and the only humor) comes from Stallone. Director Ryan Coogler (\""Fruitvale Station\"") has kept the interactions involving and made the fights forceful (especially the one that never cuts or leaves the close proximity inside the ring). This is a pumped-up version of the original, slightly too long, but big on heartfelt passion and personal power."" ]";6

The resulting group of misfits is cute in their awkward innocence, while the period style and music pervade the film's atmosphere. The band performs a number of original songs (by Carney) that prove to be catchy pop fun. In addition to the musical treats, it's a truly sweet story of a young man's efforts to express himself and his love.

On his journey, he meets some new animals (most enjoyably Bill Murray as Baloo) and has some perilous adventures. They've even tossed in 3 songs from the original film (plus a fun 2nd version of \""Bare Necessities\"" by Dr. John during the credits). As the final frame of the credits states, \""This film was shot in downtown Los Angeles,\"" but the lovely landscapes and slew of creatures is eye-catching and beautifully designed.

Her character is an extremely cheerful, slightly kooky woman with a delightful fashion sense. She's hired as caretaker/companion for a handsome man who's confined to a wheelchair (Sam Claflin). He's pretty much given up on life until her smiling charms cheer him up. But keep your hankies ready, ladies, cause the outcome is not what you'd expect. This pretty much follows the \""weepie\"" formula with prominent music that contributes to the romantic mood (of course, it includes Adele).

The performances are compelling and director Jodie Foster has crafted an interesting and mildly tense drama.

This is the case for Susan Sarandon, as she plays a New Jersey mother who moves to LA to be closer to her daughter (Rose Byrne). As the title suggests, she can't leave anyone alone: She's driven to express her opinion, give advice and even offer money. Though it's promoted as a comedy, this is more a lite drama that examines a complex woman thru several sweet interactions. As expected, Sarandon has spunky charm, but she also manages moments of quiet poignancy. The cast is good (J. K. Simmons is esp. warm) and the pace never lags. Sarandon doesn't give a flashy performance and the movie isn't striving for hilarity, but its low-key charms are undeniable."" ]";6

There's not a straight-ahead plot here, only a group of people enjoying the getaway…at first, at least. An undercurrent of attraction and jealousy adds to the tension that develops. As always, Swinton is thoroughly compelling (even though she barely speaks) and Fiennes shows a crazy energy that's both stimulating and creepy. This is unmistakably a foreign film: the interaction of the characters holds an enigmatic depth that's explored thru subtle, unhurried direction by Luca Guadagnino (\""I Am Love,\"" also starring Swinton).

Instead, they allowed the characters (and occasional funny lines) to carry the comedy. Devine is the focus of the fun: his wacky, uninhibited antics make the movie.

This takes her on adventures all over an aquatic theme park, but the sequel is darker, literally and thematically. Where the first featured colorful, delightful animation, this one often takes place in murky, gloomy environments. Dory's search leads to continuous self-doubt and hesitation. The movie runs too long, partially because the story takes too many twists and turns (ebbs and flows?). DeGeneres' flippant way with a punch line still lands the laffs and there are the requisite new wacky characters. Although less delightful than the original, it still has moments of entertaining fun.

Some of the sequences are technically astounding. Add to that the incredible scenery and immensely beautiful (mostly available light) cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. DiCaprio suffers with extreme commitment, but it’s the almost unrecognizable Tom Hardy, whose menacing villain is the acting standout.

One of the things that makes this more enjoyable is that each hero's abilities are used in interesting ways, instead of the typical massively-destructive battles. The character interaction is usually engaging and best of all, there are no long scenes of metaphysical hand-wringing or interpersonal drama. Most of the encounters are brief and compelling. The action sequences are well staged, even sometimes cool. After 2.5 hours, the last 20 minutes drag down with muddy conclusions, but it's still one of my favorite superhero flix.

The story starts in 1939 Poland, where the titular character (Jessica Chastain) and her husband (Johan Heldenbergh) lovingly care for the inhabitants of the Warsaw Zoo. When the Nazi's invade, their secret mission to shelter Jews takes the story in a dark direction. All of the actors are strong and director Niki Caro has created a mostly-compelling experience. The inhumane treatment by the Germans cast the appropriate despair and the brave actions by the zookeepers are  intrepid. Even though the subject matter has been covered many times, this film still manages to tell this true tale in with potent results."" ]";6
564;the-wedding-plan;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""A strong-willed woman in her 30s decides she must get married, so she sets a date and rents a venue. She's an Orthodox Jew and firmly believes that God will provide the right man before the big day. Although the direction has a bright tone, it isn't really a comedy, but an interesting narrative that offers insight into the traditions of her country and her faith. It's full of quiet discussions with the potential candidates about her attributes and her confidence. Noa Koler's performance helps to keep the story interesting. It's not especially energetic, but there's a compelling quality about the character and her convictions that makes it gently appealing. (Hebrew with subtitles)"" ]";6
565;manchester-by-the-sea;9;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""After the death of his brother,  Lee (Casey Affleck) learns that he's been named the guardian of his teenage nephew (Lucas Hedges). This means moving back to his small hometown where he left painful memories behind. This is a sensitive story with loveably gruff characters who have a hard time expressing their feelings and often hurt instead. Affleck and Hedges are powerful in their subtlety and restrained emotions. The script by Kenneth Lonergan is intelligently crafted with eloquently mundane observations, while his authoritative direction is detached, yet sensitive (look for him in a cameo as a man on the street who berates Affleck for his lousy parenting).  This compelling drama is impressively skillful and quietly affecting."" ]";6
566;megan-leavey;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""Kate Mara plays the titular Marine who's adrift in life until she finds Rex, a bomb-sniffing dog. As they save lives in Afghanistan, their bond grows. After they suffer separation, she mounts a campaign to adopt him. This film basically runs in those 3 parts: before Rex (which sets up her unhappiness), in country (which features some mildly suspenseful action) and back home (where she fights PTSD and to be reunited). Mara manages to capture the conflicting parts of her character with a combo of steely determination and weepy eyes. Despite the opportunities for crying and suffering, the emotions are usually subdued, which means there's no big tearful payoff. This truth-based story reveals an interesting aspect of modern warfare, while telling a spunky, yet appealing story."" ]";6
567;raw;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""A young vegetarian starts her first year at veterinary school, where part of the hazing ritual is to eat raw meat. She develops a taste for it that takes her to dreadful extremes. Since it's a vet college, expect graphic animal scenes and plenty of blood…and that's before she starts her flesh feast. The woman's gradual discovery about her new need unfolds with creepy revelations, but it's never repulsive…more intriguing, as she develops her sense of empowerment and her taste for meat. Overall, a bit slow and never suspenseful, but still an interesting take on the genre. (French with subtitles)"" ]";6
568;ingrid-goes-west;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""In a young culture that's obsessed with being \""liked\"" on social media, Ingrid (Aubrey Plaza) is an awkward misfit who's overly fanatical about her image. She moves to LA to stalk her favorite Instagram influencer (Elizabeth Olsen), who's superficial, shallow and self-possessed. Comparisons to \""Single White Female\"" are inevitable and Plaza effectively captures that creepy vibe. She also manages to make her character understandable, although not ever sympathetic. Olsen's portrayal also embodies the appropriate vacant, phony vibe. The only real sincere character is played by O'Shea Jackson, Jr. who's appealing in his first role since \""Straight Outta Compton.\"" The film's desperate narrative pushes credibility in some of the relationships (esp. his), but it does tell a compelling story. After the controversy over \""13 Reasons Why,\"" it's disconcerting that a similar subject reinforces desperate behavior, even though it effectively explores the phenomenon. BTW, there's a strange little short that precedes the feature."" ]";6
569;lion;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""The first hour of this movie takes place in India, where a 5-year-old boy gets lost, thousands of miles from home. The 2nd hour casts Dav Patel in the role as the grownup version, who's adopted by an Australian couple and ultimately decides to seek his missing family. Both segments have moments of compelling drama and beautiful cinematography. They also both go on too long: the hopeless despair in India and the mental torment in Australia. Despite engrossing performances and a remarkable story (yes, it's true), this film is in desperate need of major trimming to minimize the anguish and maximize the emotional impact."" ]";6
570;atomic-blonde;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""David Leitch also directed \""John Wick\"" and his skill with action, especially hand-to-hand fights, is ramped up here. An alluring Charlize Theron plays a cool, beautiful, tough MI6 agent who's sent to recover a sensitive document in Berlin around the time of the wall's collapse. She teams up with James McAvoy, but more importantly, takes on dozens of men with painful blows and whatever object she can use as a weapon. The fight sequences are brutally forceful and even better, there's no blurry camerawork and flashy editing to hide the hard stunt work. It's all staggeringly evident. Meanwhile, the film enjoys a colorful 80s neon noir look and the period tunes provide a jammin' soundtrack. The rather conventional plot keeps turning on itself (as spies often do) and that becomes a bit much. This film is all about the well-staged chases and fierce fights."" ]";6
571;wind-river;7;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""Jeremy Renner plays a stoic, steely-eyed Fish & Wildlife agent who discovers a corpse frozen in the snowy wilds of the titular Indian Reservation. The FBI agent that's sent from Vegas (Elizabeth Olsen, sufficiently wimpy, then sturdy) is literally out of her element. She recruits him to help track the murderer. The first hour sets up the characters with slow scenes of dialogue, then a riveting encounter happens to intensify the tension. The bleak Wyoming environment (actually shot in Utah) creates a forceful presence that adds layer of stark stress. It was refreshing to see such a strong supporting cast of Native American actors. While the outcome is compelling, the lead up takes patience."" ]";6
572;deadpool;10;TVJerry;/user/TVJerry;"[ ""Starting with the satirical opening credits, this film embraces the sassy attitude that makes this anti-superhero so much fun. Ryan Reynolds is the perfect actor to play the role. He smartly nails every clever quip and witty observation, plus he’s easy on the eyes. The script is by the guys who penned “Zombieland,” so that gives you an idea of the non-stop wise cracks and smart pop culture references that fill the dialogue. The comic-book-style action is edited with a rapid-fire pace, but unlike so many modern fights, you can follow every punch. The approach is irreverent, sarcastic and very funny. Reynolds’ delightful character, the wonderfully twisted sense of humor and the inventive approach to a stale genre combine to create the most entertaining Marvel Comic flick yet."" ]";6
